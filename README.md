# AR-VR-Video-Player
An Android app made with unity which can be used with google cardboard or any other similar VR glasses, it projects and plays videos on the photos/objects in the real world.

It is made using Unity Engine with the help of Vuforia SDK.Vuforia helps in tracking the given image/object. I used the Vuforia database to add the images i wanted to use for tracking and Vuforia provides a package for the images/objects to import in unity so that we can use them as the tracking objects.

I also wrote a small piece of code in C# to replace the default trcaking code to play the video when it is in the scene/view and pause the video when the tracking is lost.

I added the Android SDK to install the app on my android mobile.
